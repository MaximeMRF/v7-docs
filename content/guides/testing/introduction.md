# Introduction to Testing

This guide covers the testing setup in AdonisJS applications. You will learn:

- About Japa, the testing framework used by AdonisJS
- How testing is configured through suites and plugins
- How to create and run your first test
- How to filter tests by file, name, tags, or suite
- How to use watch mode for rapid development
- How to override environment variables for testing

## Overview

AdonisJS has built-in support for testing, and all starter kits come pre-configured with a complete testing setup. You can start writing tests immediately without any additional configuration.

The testing layer is powered by Japa, a testing framework we've built and maintained for over seven years. Unlike general-purpose test runners like Jest or Vitest, Japa is purpose-built for backend applications. It runs natively in Node.js without transpilers and includes plugins specifically designed for backend testing, such as an API client for testing JSON endpoints and a filesystem plugin for managing temporary files during tests.

We chose to build and maintain our own testing framework to avoid the churn that's common in the JavaScript ecosystem. Having seen the community shift from Mocha to Jest to Vitest, we're glad we invested in tooling we control and can evolve alongside AdonisJS.

## Japa and AdonisJS integration

Japa integrates deeply with AdonisJS through the `@japa/plugin-adonisjs` package. This plugin extends Japa with AdonisJS-specific utilities, giving your tests access to the application instance, route helpers for computing URLs, and methods for reading and writing cookies during HTTP and browser tests.

The integration means you write tests that feel native to AdonisJS rather than bolting on a generic test runner that doesn't understand your application's structure.

## Project structure

AdonisJS organizes tests into suites, where each suite represents a category of tests with its own configuration. A typical project structure looks like this:

```
tests/
├── bootstrap.ts
├── unit/
│   └── posts_service.spec.ts
└── browser/
    └── posts.spec.ts
```

The `tests/bootstrap.ts` file configures Japa plugins and lifecycle hooks. Individual test files live in suite directories, and each suite can have different timeouts, plugins, and setup logic appropriate for that type of testing.

### Understanding suites

A test suite groups related tests that share common characteristics. For example, unit tests run quickly and don't need an HTTP server, while browser tests require a running server and have longer timeouts to account for browser automation.

Hypermedia and Inertia starter kits come with two suites pre-configured:

- **unit** - For testing isolated pieces of code like services, utilities, and models
- **browser** - For end-to-end testing with Playwright, simulating real user interactions

Suites are defined in your `adonisrc.ts` file:

```ts title="adonisrc.ts"
{
  tests: {
    suites: [
      {
        files: ['tests/unit/**/*.spec.ts'],
        name: 'unit',
        timeout: 2000,
      },
      {
        files: ['tests/browser/**/*.spec.ts'],
        name: 'browser',
        timeout: 300000,
      },
    ],
    forceExit: false,
  }
}
```

Each suite specifies a glob pattern for locating test files, a name for filtering, and a timeout in milliseconds. Browser tests have a much longer timeout (5 minutes) because browser automation is inherently slower than in-process unit tests.

### Configuring plugins and hooks

The `tests/bootstrap.ts` file is where you configure Japa plugins and define lifecycle hooks that run before and after your test suites:

```ts title="tests/bootstrap.ts"
import { assert } from '@japa/assert'
import app from '@adonisjs/core/services/app'
import type { Config } from '@japa/runner/types'
import { pluginAdonisJS } from '@japa/plugin-adonisjs'
import testUtils from '@adonisjs/core/services/test_utils'
import { browserClient } from '@japa/browser-client'
import { authBrowserClient } from '@adonisjs/auth/plugins/browser_client'
import { sessionBrowserClient } from '@adonisjs/session/plugins/browser_client'

/**
 * Configure Japa plugins in the plugins array.
 * Learn more - https://japa.dev/docs/runner-config#plugins-optional
 */
export const plugins: Config['plugins'] = [
  assert(),
  pluginAdonisJS(app),
  browserClient({ runInSuites: ['browser'] }),
  sessionBrowserClient(app),
  authBrowserClient(app),
]

/**
 * Configure lifecycle function to run before and after all the
 * tests.
 */
export const runnerHooks: Required<Pick<Config, 'setup' | 'teardown'>> = {
  setup: [],
  teardown: [],
}

/**
 * Configure suites by tapping into the test suite instance.
 * Learn more - https://japa.dev/docs/test-suites#lifecycle-hooks
 */
export const configureSuite: Config['configureSuite'] = (suite) => {
  if (['browser', 'functional', 'e2e'].includes(suite.name)) {
    return suite.setup(() => testUtils.httpServer().start())
  }
}
```

The `configureSuite` function allows you to add setup logic specific to certain suites. In this example, browser, functional, and e2e suites automatically start the HTTP server before tests run.

## Creating your first test

Generate a new test file using the `make:test` command:

```sh
node ace make:test posts/index --suite=browser
```

This creates a test file at `tests/browser/posts/index.spec.ts` with the following structure:

```ts title="tests/browser/posts/index.spec.ts"
import { test } from '@japa/runner'

test.group('Posts index', () => {
  test('display a list of all posts', async ({ assert }) => {
  })
})
```

Tests are organized into groups using `test.group()`, which helps structure related tests and allows you to apply shared setup and teardown logic. Individual tests are defined with `test()` and receive a context object containing utilities like `assert` for making assertions.

## Running tests

Run your entire test suite with:

```sh
node ace test
```

To run a specific suite, pass the suite name as an argument:

```sh
node ace test unit
node ace test browser
```

### Filtering tests

Japa provides several flags for running a subset of tests:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--tests` | Filter by exact test title |
| `--files` | Filter by test filename (matches against the end of the filename without `.spec.ts`) |
| `--groups` | Filter by exact group name |
| `--tags` | Filter by tags (prefix with `~` to exclude) |
| `--matchAll` | Require all specified tags to match instead of any | 

The `--files` flag supports wildcards for running all tests in a directory:

```sh
# Run a specific test file
node ace test --files="posts/index"

# Run all tests in the posts directory
node ace test --files="posts/*"
```

Filter by test title or group name for precise control:

```sh
# Run tests with exact title match
node ace test --tests="can list all posts"

# Run all tests in a specific group
node ace test --groups="Posts index"
```

### Watch mode

During development, use watch mode to automatically re-run tests when files change:

```sh
node ace test --watch
```

When a test file changes, only that file's tests are re-run. When a source file changes, all tests are executed.

:::tip
If you're iterating on a single test, combine watch mode with the `--files` filter. This ensures any file change runs only the tests you're focused on, providing faster feedback.

```sh
node ace test --watch --files="posts/index"
```
:::

### Additional flags

Two flags are particularly useful during development:

```sh
# Stop on first failure
node ace test --bail

# Re-run only tests that failed in the last run
node ace test --failed
```

The `--bail` flag helps when debugging a failing test by preventing subsequent tests from running. The `--failed` flag is useful for quickly verifying that your fix resolved all failures without running the entire suite.

## Environment variables

AdonisJS automatically loads a `.env.test` file when running tests, merging its values with your standard `.env` file. Any variable defined in `.env.test` overrides the corresponding value from `.env`.

Create a `.env.test` file in your project root to configure test-specific settings:

```dotenv title=".env.test"
SESSION_DRIVER=memory
```

The memory session driver is commonly used in tests because it doesn't persist sessions between requests, ensuring test isolation. Other variables you might override include database connection settings, mail drivers, or any service configuration that should behave differently during testing.

# Assembler hooks

This guide covers Assembler hooks in AdonisJS. You will learn how to:

- Register hooks to respond to lifecycle events during development, testing, and builds
- React to file changes in watch mode
- Hook into the routes scanning pipeline
- Generate barrel files and type declarations using the IndexGenerator
- Create custom code generation workflows

## Overview

Assembler is the build tooling layer of AdonisJS that manages your application as a child process. It handles starting the development server, running tests, and creating production builds. Hooks let you tap into this lifecycle to run custom actions at specific moments, such as generating barrel files when controllers change, creating type declarations when routes are scanned, or displaying custom information when the server starts.

Because Assembler runs in a separate process from your AdonisJS application, hooks do not have access to framework features like the IoC container, router service, or database connections. Instead, hooks receive purpose-built utilities like the `IndexGenerator` for code generation and scanner instances for route analysis.

Common use cases for Assembler hooks include generating barrel files for lazy-loading controllers, creating type-safe API clients from route metadata, running code generators when files change, and displaying custom startup information.

## Hooks reference

The following table lists all available hooks, when they execute, and what parameters they receive.

| Hook | Triggered by | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `init` | DevServer, TestRunner, Bundler | First hook executed. Use for initialization tasks |
| `devServerStarting` | DevServer | Before the child process starts |
| `devServerStarted` | DevServer | After the child process is running |
| `testsStarting` | TestRunner | Before tests begin executing |
| `testsFinished` | TestRunner | After tests complete |
| `buildStarting` | Bundler | Before production build begins |
| `buildFinished` | Bundler | After production build completes |
| `fileChanged` | DevServer, TestRunner | When a file is modified in watch mode |
| `fileAdded` | DevServer, TestRunner | When a file is created |
| `fileRemoved` | DevServer, TestRunner | When a file is deleted |
| `routesCommitted` | DevServer | When routes are registered by the app |
| `routesScanning` | DevServer | Before route type scanning begins |
| `routesScanned` | DevServer | After route type scanning completes |

## Creating and registering hooks

Hooks are registered in the `adonisrc.ts` file under the `hooks` property. Each hook accepts an array of lazy-loaded imports, allowing you to split hook logic into separate files and only load them when needed.

```ts title="adonisrc.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default defineConfig({
  hooks: {
    devServerStarted: [() => import('./hooks/on_server_started.ts')],
    fileChanged: [() => import('./hooks/on_file_changed.ts')],
  },
})
```

The hook file must export a default function that receives the hook's parameters. Each hook has a typed helper available from `@adonisjs/core/app` that provides full TypeScript support for the parameters.

```ts title="hooks/on_server_started.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.devServerStarted((devServer, info, instructions) => {
  /**
   * info.host - The host address the server is bound to
   * info.port - The port number the server is running on
   * instructions - UI helper for displaying formatted output
   */
  console.log(`Server running at http://${info.host}:${info.port}`)
})
```

You can register multiple hooks for the same event. They execute in the order they are registered.

```ts title="adonisrc.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default defineConfig({
  hooks: {
    devServerStarted: [
      () => import('./hooks/log_server_info.ts'),
      () => import('./hooks/notify_external_service.ts'),
    ],
  },
})
```

:::warning
Assembler hooks run in a separate process from your AdonisJS application. They do not have access to the IoC container, router, database, or any other framework services. If you need to interact with your application, use the routes scanning hooks to extract metadata or communicate via HTTP/IPC.
:::

## Init hook

The `init` hook is the first hook executed when Assembler starts any operation. It receives the parent instance (DevServer, TestRunner, or Bundler), a hooks manager for registering additional runtime hooks, and the IndexGenerator for code generation tasks.

```ts title="hooks/init.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.init((parent, hooksManager, indexGenerator) => {
  /**
   * Determine what operation is running by checking the parent type.
   * Use indexGenerator to set up barrel file or type generation.
   */
  console.log('Assembler initialized')
})
```

The `init` hook is the recommended place to configure the IndexGenerator for barrel file and type generation, as it runs before any other operations begin.

## Dev server hooks

The dev server hooks execute when starting and running the development server. The `devServerStarting` hook fires before the child process launches, and `devServerStarted` fires once the server is accepting connections.

```ts title="hooks/on_dev_server_starting.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.devServerStarting((devServer) => {
  /**
   * Perform setup tasks before the server starts.
   * The child process has not been spawned yet.
   */
  console.log('Preparing to start dev server...')
})
```

```ts title="hooks/on_dev_server_started.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.devServerStarted((devServer, info, instructions) => {
  /**
   * The server is now running and accepting connections.
   * Use instructions to add custom UI output.
   */
  instructions.add('custom', `API docs: http://${info.host}:${info.port}/docs`)
})
```

These hooks re-trigger every time the child process restarts, such as when a full reload occurs due to file changes.

## Test runner hooks

The test runner hooks execute before and after running your test suite. Use `testsStarting` to set up test fixtures or databases, and `testsFinished` to generate reports or clean up resources.

```ts title="hooks/on_tests_starting.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.testsStarting((testRunner) => {
  console.log('Preparing test environment...')
})
```

```ts title="hooks/on_tests_finished.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.testsFinished((testRunner) => {
  console.log('Tests complete, generating coverage report...')
})
```

When running tests in watch mode, these hooks re-trigger each time the test suite re-runs.

## Bundler hooks

The bundler hooks execute when creating a production build with `node ace build`. Use `buildStarting` for pre-build tasks like asset optimization, and `buildFinished` to display build statistics or run post-build scripts.

```ts title="hooks/on_build_starting.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.buildStarting((bundler) => {
  console.log('Starting production build...')
})
```

```ts title="hooks/on_build_finished.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.buildFinished((bundler, instructions) => {
  instructions.add('deploy', 'Run `npm run start` in the build folder to start the server')
})
```

## Watcher hooks

The watcher hooks fire when files change during development or test watch mode. In HMR mode, Assembler relies on hot-hook to detect changes; otherwise, the built-in file watcher handles detection.

Each watcher hook receives both the relative path (from your application root, using Unix-style slashes) and the absolute path to the affected file.

```ts title="hooks/on_file_changed.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.fileChanged((relativePath, absolutePath, info, parent) => {
  /**
   * info.source - Either 'hot-hook' or 'watcher'
   * info.hotReloaded - True if the file was hot reloaded without restart
   * info.fullReload - True if a full server restart is required
   */
  if (relativePath.startsWith('app/controllers/')) {
    console.log(`Controller changed: ${relativePath}`)
  }
})
```

```ts title="hooks/on_file_added.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.fileAdded((relativePath, absolutePath, parent) => {
  console.log(`New file created: ${relativePath}`)
})
```

```ts title="hooks/on_file_removed.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.fileRemoved((relativePath, absolutePath, parent) => {
  console.log(`File deleted: ${relativePath}`)
})
```

## Routes hooks

The routes hooks provide access to your application's route definitions and their associated types. These hooks only execute during dev server operation, not during builds or tests.

### Routes committed

The `routesCommitted` hook fires when your AdonisJS application registers its routes. The routes are transmitted from the child process to Assembler via IPC, giving you access to route metadata without parsing files yourself.

```ts title="hooks/on_routes_committed.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.routesCommitted((devServer, routes) => {
  /**
   * routes is an object with domains as keys.
   * Each domain contains an array of route definitions.
   */
  const defaultRoutes = routes['root'] || []
  console.log(`${defaultRoutes.length} routes registered`)
})
```

### Routes scanning

The `routesScanning` hook fires before Assembler begins analyzing your routes to extract request and response types. Use this hook to configure the scanner, such as skipping certain routes from analysis.

```ts title="hooks/on_routes_scanning.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.routesScanning((devServer, routesScanner) => {
  /**
   * Skip routes that don't need type extraction,
   * such as authentication endpoints with complex flows.
   */
  routesScanner.skip(['session.create', 'session.store', 'oauth.callback'])
})
```

### Routes scanned

The `routesScanned` hook fires after route analysis completes. The scanner contains extracted type information that you can use to generate API clients or type declarations.

```ts title="hooks/on_routes_scanned.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.routesScanned((devServer, routesScanner) => {
  const routes = routesScanner.getRoutes()
  const controllers = routesScanner.getControllers()
  
  /**
   * Use this metadata to generate type-safe API clients.
   * The types are internal import references, not standalone types.
   */
  console.log(`Scanned ${routes.length} routes from ${controllers.length} controllers`)
})
```

:::note
The types extracted by the routes scanner are internal import references pointing to your controllers and validators. They are not fully resolved standalone types that can be used in a separate project. Generating standalone types requires additional tooling like [Tuyau](https://tuyau.julr.dev/docs/introduction).
:::

## IndexGenerator

The IndexGenerator is a utility for watching directories and generating barrel files or type declarations from their contents. It handles file watching automatically, regenerating output files when source files are added or removed.

### Configuring the IndexGenerator

Register IndexGenerator configurations in the `init` hook. Each configuration specifies a source directory to watch, an output file to generate, and how to transform the source files.

```ts title="hooks/init.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.init((parent, hooksManager, indexGenerator) => {
  indexGenerator.add('controllers', {
    source: './app/controllers',
    importAlias: '#controllers',
    as: 'barrelFile',
    exportName: 'controllers',
    removeSuffix: 'controller',
    output: './.adonisjs/server/controllers.ts',
  })
})
```

The configuration options are:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `source` | Directory to scan for source files |
| `importAlias` | The import alias to use in generated imports (e.g., `#controllers`) |
| `as` | Either `'barrelFile'` for automatic generation or a callback for custom output |
| `exportName` | Name of the exported constant in barrel files |
| `removeSuffix` | Suffix to strip from file names when generating property keys |
| `output` | Path where the generated file will be written |

### Barrel file generation

When `as` is set to `'barrelFile'`, the IndexGenerator scans the source directory recursively and generates a barrel file that exports lazy-loaded imports. The directory structure is preserved as nested objects.

Given this controller structure:

```
app/controllers/
├── auth/
│   ├── login_controller.ts
│   └── register_controller.ts
├── blog/
│   ├── posts_controller.ts
│   └── post_comments_controller.ts
└── users_controller.ts
```

The IndexGenerator produces:

```ts title=".adonisjs/server/controllers.ts"
export const controllers = {
  auth: {
    Login: () => import('#controllers/auth/login_controller'),
    Register: () => import('#controllers/auth/register_controller'),
  },
  blog: {
    Posts: () => import('#controllers/blog/posts_controller'),
    PostComments: () => import('#controllers/blog/post_comments_controller'),
  },
  Users: () => import('#controllers/users_controller'),
}
```

This barrel file enables lazy-loading controllers in your routes without manual import management. The file automatically updates when you add or remove controllers.

### Custom type generation

For generating type declarations or other custom output, pass a callback function to the `as` option. The callback receives a collection of files and a writer utility for building the output string.

The files collection is a key-value object where each key is the relative path (without extension) from the source directory, and each value contains the file's `importPath`, `relativePath`, and `absolutePath`.

```ts title="hooks/init.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.init((parent, hooksManager, indexGenerator) => {
  indexGenerator.add('inertiaPages', {
    source: './inertia/pages',
    as: (files, writer) => {
      writer.writeLine(`declare module '@adonisjs/inertia' {`).indent()
      writer.writeLine(`export interface Pages {`).indent()

      for (const [filePath, file] of Object.entries(files)) {
        writer.writeLine(
          `'${filePath}': InferPageProps<typeof import('${file.importPath}').default>`
        )
      }

      writer.dedent().writeLine('}')
      writer.dedent().writeLine('}')

      return writer.toString()
    },
    output: './.adonisjs/server/inertia_pages.d.ts',
  })
})
```

This generates a type declaration file that maps page component paths to their prop types, enabling type-safe Inertia.js page rendering.

### Complete IndexGenerator example

The following example shows a complete `init` hook that configures barrel file generation for controllers, events, and listeners—the default setup used by the AdonisJS framework.

```ts title="hooks/init.ts"
import { hooks } from '@adonisjs/core/app'

export default hooks.init((parent, hooksManager, indexGenerator) => {
  /**
   * Generate a barrel file for controllers.
   * Enables lazy-loading in routes: [controllers.Posts, 'index']
   */
  indexGenerator.add('controllers', {
    source: './app/controllers',
    importAlias: '#controllers',
    as: 'barrelFile',
    exportName: 'controllers',
    removeSuffix: 'controller',
    output: './.adonisjs/server/controllers.ts',
  })

  /**
   * Generate a barrel file for event classes.
   * Enables type-safe event emission.
   */
  indexGenerator.add('events', {
    source: './app/events',
    importAlias: '#events',
    as: 'barrelFile',
    exportName: 'events',
    output: './.adonisjs/server/events.ts',
  })

  /**
   * Generate a barrel file for event listeners.
   * Enables lazy-loading listeners in event bindings.
   */
  indexGenerator.add('listeners', {
    source: './app/listeners',
    importAlias: '#listeners',
    as: 'barrelFile',
    exportName: 'listeners',
    output: './.adonisjs/server/listeners.ts',
  })
})
```
